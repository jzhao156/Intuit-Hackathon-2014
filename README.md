This program is an educational game designed for students from K-12 in teaching basic financial concepts. It was written in Java using the objectdraw and java swing libraries. The premise is that you are from the future living on a planet about to explode and must purchase 5 space ship parts, which cost a significant amount of money. You get income each round and have to make a financial decision which can impact your income, current money, and space ship parts. If you run out of time or lose all your money you lose. Thus the player must learn to budget their money (and not purchase the spaceship parts too quickly all at once) as well as invest smartly. (Not all investments are created equal!)
